Journal:

For my third exploration, I continued from my first exploration and dove deeper into the world of Bootstrap and ReactJS. My first exploration used very basic Bootstrap tools, whereas in this exploration I took it a step further to explore more intricate styles. In term of react, when I first was introduced to it, I learned its essential concepts. Those concepts being JSX, components, and storing information via props and state. These concepts helped me to build a foundation for React as well as prepare me for my next steps into the React world. 

I continued my journey by again using Codecademy’s training program to learn more about React. In my first exploration I completed the training sequence “Learn ReactJS: Part 1” and this time to dig into more advanced topics, I completed “Learn ReactJS: Part 2”. Part 2 of the React training program went into lifestyle methods, Prop Types, basic styling, stateless functional components, and other advanced topics.

I created a website that tells the journey of my React and Bootstrap venture.
